<b>The columns in the result set are as follows: </b>

AvailabilityGroupName: The name of the Always On availability group.

ReplicaServerName: The name of the replica server.

ConnectedState: The current connection state of the replica.

LastConnectErrorNumber: The error number of the last connection attempt.

LastConnectErrorDescription: The description of the last connection error.

DatabaseName: The name of the database.

LogSendQueueSize: The log send queue size (in KB) indicating the amount of log records waiting to be sent to the secondary replica.

LogSendRate: The log send rate (in KB/sec) showing the rate at which log records are being sent to the secondary replica.

RedoQueueSize: The redo queue size (in KB) indicating the amount of log records waiting to be applied on the secondary replica.

RedoRate: The redo rate (in KB/sec) showing the rate at which log records are being applied on the secondary replica.

LastCommitTime: The last time a transaction was committed on the primary replica.

By analyzing this data, you can identify the latency between the primary and secondary replicas, which helps in understanding 
the data synchronization status and performance of the Always On availability group.
