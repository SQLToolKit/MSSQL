<h2>Start/Stop MS SQL Server services using command line</h2><hr>

<b>Start command line “As Administrator”. 
Right click command line >> Run as administrator</b>


<b>Check the SQL services names using below comman</b>

<b>C:\WINDOWS\system32>tasklist /svc | find /i "sql"</b>
sqlwriter.exe                  3812 SQLWriter
sqlbrowser.exe               3872 SQLBrowser
fdlauncher.exe                8676 MSSQLFDLauncher$MSSQLSERVER2016
sqlservr.exe                   11964 MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016
SQLAGENT.EXE               4004 SQLAgent$MSSQLSERVER2016


<b>Use windows NET interface to STOP/START services</b>

<b>C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET STOP MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016</b>
The following services are dependent on the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service.
Stopping the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service will also stop these services.

SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016)

Do you want to continue this operation? (Y/N) [N]: Y
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

<b>Note: Agent service is dependent on SQL database service, therefore it will also be stoped</b>

<b>We can also provide “Y” option with NET stop command to stop SQL agent service</b>

<b>C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET STOP MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016 /Y</b>

The following services are dependent on the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service.
Stopping the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service will also stop these services.

SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016)

The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

<b>C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET START MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016</b>
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is starting.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was started successfully.



<b>Similarly, you can start/stop agent service</b>

<b>C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET START SQLAgent$MSSQLSERVER2016</b>
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is starting.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was started successfully.



<b>Stop SQL instance using TSQL </b>

<b>SHUTDOWN</b>
You can stop the SQL Server instance using T-SQL by executing the SHUTDOWN command. 
The SHUTDOWN command gracefully stops the SQL Server instance and is equivalent to 
stopping the SQL Server service.

<b>SHUTDOWN [ WITH NOWAIT ]</b>
The optional WITH NOWAIT clause specifies that the command should take effect immediately 
without waiting for the connections to complete their transactions. 
This is like "shutdown abort" in Oracle.
