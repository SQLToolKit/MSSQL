C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET STOP MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016
The following services are dependent on the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service.
Stopping the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service will also stop these services.

SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016)

Do you want to continue this operation? (Y/N) [N]: Y
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.
</p>

<p class="note">Note: Agent service is dependent on SQL database service, therefore it will also be stoped</p>
<p class="text bold">We can also provide “Y” option with NET stop command to stop SQL agent service</p>
<p class="os">
C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET STOP MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016 /Y

The following services are dependent on the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service.
Stopping the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service will also stop these services.

SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016)

The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is stopping.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was stopped successfully.

C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET START MSSQL$MSSQLSERVER2016
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is starting.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was started successfully.
</p>

<p class="text bold">Similarly, you can start/stop agent service</p>
<p class="os">
C:\WINDOWS\system32>NET START SQLAgent$MSSQLSERVER2016
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service is starting.
The SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER2016) service was started successfully.

<p class="heading">Stop SQL instance using TSQL</p>

<p class="text bold">SHUTDOWN</p>
You can stop the SQL Server instance using T-SQL by executing the SHUTDOWN command. 
The SHUTDOWN command gracefully stops the SQL Server instance and is equivalent to 
stopping the SQL Server service.

<p class="text bold">SHUTDOWN [ WITH NOWAIT ]</p>
The optional WITH NOWAIT clause specifies that the command should take effect immediately 
without waiting for the connections to complete their transactions. 
This is like "shutdown abort" in Oracle.
