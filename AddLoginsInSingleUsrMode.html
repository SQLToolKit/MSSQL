<h2>Add Windows\SQL login to instanace in single user mode</h2><hr>

<b>Add Windows or SQL login to SQL Instanace with SYSADMIN 
Reset "sa" password or enable "sa" account
</b>

We may have a situation when we cannot connect to SQL instance due to missing Windows users/group under SQL logins
OR we cannot connect using "sa" as we don't know the password or "sa" was disabled

In this situation, if we are connected to Windows server using account with administrator permissions, we can start SQL 
instance in single user mode and add the required logins

Prerequisite: You must login to Windows machine with the account which is member of local administrator group

<b>Open command line with Administrator mode</b>

<b>Stop the service</b>
net stop MSSQL$SQLLAB

<b>Start the service in single user mode using /mSQLCMD option</b>
net start MSSQL$SQLLAB /f /mSQLCMD

<b>Connect SQLCMD and create login with sysadmin permission</b>
sqlcmd.exe -E -S WINSQL2017\SQLLAB -Q "CREATE LOGIN [SQLLAB\build_group] FROM WINDOWS; ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER [SQLLAB\build_group]; "

<b>If SQL server has mixed mode, you can also create a SQL Login with sysadmin permission</b>
sqlcmd.exe -E -S WINSQL2017\SQLLAB -Q "CREATE LOGIN TempLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'Summer@2023'; ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER TempLogin;"

<b>If SQL server is in mixed mode, you can also also reset the "sa" password or enable it if it was disabled</b>
sqlcmd.exe -E -S WINSQL2017\SQLLAB -Q "ALTER LOGIN [sa] WITH PASSWORD=N'Winter@2023'; ALTER LOGIN [sa] ENABLE;"

<b>Then stop and start SQL service in normal multi user mode</b>
net stop MSSQL$SQLLAB
net start MSSQL$SQLLAB
